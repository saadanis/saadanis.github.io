        <p>“All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
            Not all those who wander are lost; <br>
            The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
            Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br>

            From the ashes a fire shall be woken, <br>
            A light from the shadows shall spring; <br>
            Renewed shall be blade that was broken, <br>
            The crownless again shall be king.”</p>
